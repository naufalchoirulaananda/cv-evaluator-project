JOB DESCRIPTION - PRODUCT ENGINEER (BACKEND)
============================================

Rakamin is hiring a Product Engineer (Backend) to work on Rakamin. 
We’re looking for dedicated engineers who write code they’re proud of and who are eager to keep scaling and improving complex systems, including those powered by AI.


ABOUT THE JOB
--------------

You'll be building new product features alongside a frontend engineer and product manager using our Agile methodology, 
as well as addressing issues to ensure our apps are robust and our codebase is clean. 
As a Product Engineer, you'll write clean, efficient code to enhance our product's backend in meaningful ways.

In addition to classic backend work, this role also involves building AI-powered systems, 
where you’ll design and orchestrate how large language models (LLMs) integrate into Rakamin’s product ecosystem.


EXAMPLES OF WORK
----------------

- Collaborate with frontend engineers and 3rd parties to build robust backend solutions that support configurable platforms and cross-platform integration.
- Develop and maintain server-side logic for central databases, ensuring high performance throughput and response time.
- Design and fine-tune AI prompts aligned with product requirements and user contexts.
- Build LLM chaining flows, where the output from one model is enriched by another.
- Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using vector databases to improve accuracy and relevance.
- Handle long-running AI processes gracefully, including job orchestration, async background workers, and retry mechanisms.
- Design safeguards for failure cases and manage the randomness of LLM outputs.
- Use AI tools to increase productivity (AI-assisted code generation, automated QA, internal bots).
- Write reusable, testable, and efficient code to improve existing systems.
- Strengthen test coverage with RSpec to ensure reliability.
- Conduct full product lifecycles: ideation, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
- Provide input on technical feasibility, timelines, and trade-offs with business divisions.
- Engage with users and stakeholders to understand their needs and translate them into backend and AI-driven improvements.


ABOUT YOU
----------

We’re looking for candidates with a strong track record of working on backend technologies of web applications, 
ideally with exposure to AI/LLM development or a strong desire to learn.

You should have experience with:

- Backend languages and frameworks (Node.js, Django, Rails)
- Database management (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- RESTful APIs
- Security compliance
- Cloud technologies (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
- Server-side languages (Java, Python, Ruby, JavaScript)
- Understanding frontend technologies
- Authentication and authorization between multiple systems and environments
- Scalable application design principles
- Database schema design that supports business processes
- Automated testing platforms and unit tests
- Familiarity with LLM APIs, embeddings, vector databases, and prompt design best practices


WHAT WE VALUE
--------------

We care about what you can do and how you do it — not your degree or where you studied. 
You’ll report directly to the CTO and be trusted to deliver impactful work independently.  
Rakamin values “Managers of One” — people who take initiative, own their work, and deliver with minimal supervision.

This is a remote position.  
You’re free to work wherever you perform best (home office, co-working space, or coffee shop).  
To ensure time zone overlap and good communication, we’re only looking for candidates based in Indonesia.

BENEFITS & PERKS
-----------------

Our benefits support a well-balanced life and your continued growth:

1. Paid Time Off
   - 17 days of vacation and personal days per year.
   - Take a day off without a specific reason — whether for rest, travel, or personal time.

2. Learning Benefits (Total Rp29 million/year)
   - Rp6 million/year for online courses, books, or skill development.
   - O’Reilly subscription worth Rp8 million/year for access to the latest books and tech content.
   - Access to all Rakamin Bootcamps & Short Courses worth Rp15 million/year.

3. Device Ownership
   - Rp7 million/year allowance to purchase devices supporting productivity.
